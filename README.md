# Bike_Shop_Application_Frontend_Android
This is a front end application written in Kotlin that connects to a back end and retrieves data from there.

This is a simple Android application that consists of 6 activities. All of them are linked to MainActivity which inflates activity_main.xml, where the applicaton boots up and from where the other ones can be accessed.

In the res folder there are the XML resources for this project. These are organised in folders like drawable, where all the icons that are to be drawn on the screen are located along with a png image that I use as a background for one of the activities.

The activity layout resource files are located in the layout subfolder. They are organized as such: activity_main is the main activity, where the application starts on runtime; activity_product_table is the view for the getProducts GET request; activity_add_product_form is a form for submitting new products to the database, while activity_product_delete is a view where we select a product and can delete it ata a click of a button. Finally, activity_product_update opens a window where we select the product we want to update. After selecting, activity_product_update_form is opened with a view similar to activity_add_product_form, but this time, the values are pre-completed with the ones from the product selected beforehand, in order to be able to see what modifications we are doing tot the current item.

The mipmap folder has the app icons that are going to be shown in the Android phone drawer or on the Play Store. The icons are of 2 kinds, one as a square and one as a circle, each one to be used in different scenarios, depending on the situation. Also, there is an instance of each icon at different sizes, again, to be used according to the situation. These were manually generated by me from Android Studio from the menu new->Image/Vector Asset. The same can be said about all the images from the drawable folder.

The last folder that I modified is values, where all relevant values are stored. These values include hexa encoded colors, each one with a unique name (or id), strings like the application name and titles for different fragments. Lastly, there is a folder here called themes, which describes themes for the whole application. I have implemented 2 themes, one for light mode and another one for dark mode, which is very useful because nearly all Android phones nowadays have a setting for setting the overall phone theme and the apps are instructed to follow the system theme. So depending on the user preference my app is robust and the colors can be modified so it matches the overall theme.

Here is a diagram of the classes for this application:
